WebGL Digital Terrarium

The goal of the project was to generate a 3D digital Terrarium in webbased environment using the three.js library. A lot of theme and design changes were made through development, originally the model was meant to be a cherry blossom near a hotspring. In the end, it ended up looking so much better as a winter themed hotsprings. Ambient snowfall adorns the screen with an icy gradient backdrop that transitions along with the light to emulate a day and night effect in the scene. The 3D models were all custom made, however textures and other maps were borrowed from online repositories such as those under resources used.

Time Spent Per Element:
    Documentation reading: untracked // I didn't see it to be too pertinent to track time spent on research
    Modelling: 4 hours // Tried to minimize this time as much as possible while producing a still visually appealling model
    Creating WebApp Environment: 2 hours // this was mostly figuring out
    Importing Models: 2 hours // took a while to figure out how to actually import and modify gltf model types
    Day & Night Background: 4 hours // more hours were spent exploring alternatives, but this accurately represents the current background
    Day & Night Lighting: 3 hours // was easier to set up than anticipated, I synced the lighting based on the middle background pixel and it work!
    Texturing Models: 5+ hours // lots of additional untracked time for this step, ended up going down several rabbit holes for several methods
    Misc: There was additional time spent on mixed modifications and fine tuning, but the previous times reported are rough estimates
    Total Time Spent: If I had to estimate probably 20-30 hours, nothing too excessive due to work balance this term, but I dedicated any time available to this project whenever possible. It was definitely tough balancing between other term project such as from machine learning.
